# NLPDoctor-StreamlitApp

Personal Project

## Description

I have developed a natural language processing web application using Streamlit (for the web interface) 
so users could easily perform various fundamental NLP tasks on the go either from a manually inputted 
or from a URL extracted text, such as: Ngram extraction, plotting POS tags frequency, named entity 
extraction or sentiment analysis. The application is hosted on Heroku.
